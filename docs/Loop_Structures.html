<h1>Loop Structures</h1>
<p>ViviFire's loop structures allow you to repeatedly execute a set of statements. You can repeat statements while a condition is true, until a condition becomes false, a specified number of times, or once per element in a collection.</p>
<h2>While loops</h2>
<p>The <span class="kw">While...End While</span> construction executes a block of statements as long as the condition specified in the <span class="kw">While</span> clause is true. For more information, see <a href="While_End_While_Statement.html">While...End While Statement</a>.</p>
<h2>Do loops</h2>
<p>The <span class="kw">Do...Loop</span> construction is similar to <span class="kw">While...End While</span> but with greater flexibility. You can test the condition either at the beginning or the end and you specify whether the loop executes while  the condition is true or until it becomes true. For more information, see <a href="Do_Loop_Statement.html">Do...Loop Statement</a>.</p>
<h2>For loops</h2>
<p>The <span class="kw">For...End For</span> construction executes a block of statements a fixed number of iterations. It steps through a range of values assigning a variable, called the counter, a  different value for each iteration. You can optionally specify the step size, which has a default of 1. For more information, see <a href="For_End_For_Statement.html">For...End For Statement</a>.</p>
<h2>For Each loops</h2>
<p>The <span class="kw">For Each...End For</span> construction executes a block of statements once for each element in a collection. It is best used where you can safely disregard factors such as the size and order of the collection. For more information, see <a href="For_Each_End_For_Statement.html">For Each...End For Statement</a>.</p>
<h2>Afterward and Otherwise clauses</h2>
<p>For most loop structures, ViviFire supports two statements that appear inside the loop but are executed outside of it. The <span class="kw">Afterward</span> clause is executed only if the body of the loop in which it appears executed fully and exited normally. The <span class="kw">Otherwise</span> clause is executed only if the body of the loop was never entered. For more information, see <a href="Afterward_Otherwise_Clauses.html">Afterward...Otherwise Clauses</a>.</p>
