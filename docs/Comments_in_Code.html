<h1><a id="top"></a>Comments in Code</h1>
<p>Throughout this documentation you will see examples of ViviFire code with comments. The majority of these comments begin with the apostrophe (<span class="op">'</span>) and end at the end of the line. Comments are ignored by the ViviFire compiler. Comments are placed in code to explain what some code does, and often they give other details.</p>
<p>There are two types of comments: the inline comment, as mentioned above, and the block comment. A block comment has two markers that explicitly mark the start and end of a comment. Block comments can contain several lines, and usually do. However, block comments can also be placed between programming elements within a single line, though the practice can make code harder to read.</p>
<p>The block comment in ViviFire comes in two forms. The first starts with <span class="op">/'</span> and ends with <span class="op">'/</span>. The second form uses the markers <span class="op">/*</span> and <span class="op">*/</span>, respectively.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="language-vivifire listing">
<pre><code>' This is a full-line comment
#debug "Test" ' This comment is inline with code
#out "Hi " &amp; name$ _  ' This comment
    &amp; " how are you?" ' is split in two
/' This is a short block comment '/
/* This is a rather long block comment
   that needs to be split across more
   than one line
*/
Call Test 1 /'one'/, 2 /'two'/, 3 /'three'/&#10;</code></pre>
