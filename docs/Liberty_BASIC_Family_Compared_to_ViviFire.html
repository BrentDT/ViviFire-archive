<h1>Liberty BASIC Family Compared to ViviFire</h1>
<p>The syntax of ViviFire was inspired by Liberty BASIC and Run BASIC, but it is not the same language. The following document will summarize the major differences.</p>
<h2>Names</h2>
<p>ViviFire offers much greater freedom in naming entities such as variables and functions. ViviFire has deep support for Unicode and allows names in numerous scripts, including Latin with diacritics, Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic, Chinese, and more.</p>
<p>All names in ViviFire are case-insensitive, not just keywords. This was chosen to make it easier to share and reuse code. If somebody writes a library that uses a capitalization scheme you don't like, just type the names the way you prefer!</p>
<p>For more details, see <a href="Declared_Element_Names.html#">Declared Element Names</a>.</p>
<h2>Scoping</h2>
<p>Both LB and RB have rather complicated scoping rules compared to ViviFire. In ViviFire, any named entity defined outside of a construction is visible within it. That means that ViviFire has no need for a GLOBAL keyword, because anything defined at the outermost level is automatically global. </p>
<p>Like RB, block constructions (such as loops) create a new scoping level. This means that variables defined within these blocks are not visible outside them.</p>
<p>Also like RB, ViviFire allows for user-defined objects, but with much more functionality. Whereas RB reuses functions to define an object's methods, ViviFire has a <a href="Method_Statement.html#">Method</a> keyword specifically for this purpose. <a href="Sub_Statement.html#">Subs</a> and <a href="Function_Statement.html#">Functions</a> in ViviFire are always private to the object in which they are defined.</p>
<h2>Labels</h2>
<p>ViviFire has no support for branch labels. Although ViviFire permits the use of what look like labels in certain statements, be assured they are not labels. This means that all branching in ViviFire must be done in a structured way. These ways include procedures (<a href="Sub_Statement.html#">Sub</a>, <a href="Function_Statement.html#">Function</a>, <a href="Method_Statement.html#">Method</a>), structured loops (<a href="Do_Loop_Statement.html#">Do...Loop</a>, <a href="While_End_While_Statement.html#">While...End While</a>, <a href="For_End_For_Statement.html#">For...End For</a>, <a href="For_Each_End_For_Statement.html#">For Each...End For</a>) and <a href="Exit_Statement.html#">Exit</a>, <a href="If_Then_Else_Statement.html#">If...Then...Else</a>, and <a href="Select_Case_Statement.html#">Select...Case</a>.</p>
<p>ViviFire lacks GOSUB, but retains a form of GOTO. The <a href="GoTo_Case_Statement.html#">GoTo Case</a> statement is permitted within a <a href="Select_Case_Statement.html#">Select...Case</a> block.</p>
<p>Also, ViviFire lacks ON ERROR GOTO. Instead, it uses structured exception handling, using <a href="Try_Catch_Finally_Statement.html#">Try...Catch...Finally</a> blocks.</p>
<h2>Comparison of features</h2>
<h3>Feature equivalence</h3>
<p>The following is a summary of the features of LB that should not require any changes to code being ported to ViviFire.</p>
<table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th>Feature</th><th>Notes</th></tr>

<tbody>
<tr><td>Arithmetic operators</td><td>+, -, *, /, <span class="kw">Mod</span>, ^</td></tr>
<tr><td>Comparison operators</td><td>&lt;, &lt;=, =, &lt;&gt;, &gt;, &gt;=</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="kw">Do...Loop</span> statement</td><td>Multi-line form only</td></tr>

<tr><td><span class="kw">If...Then...Else</span> statement</td><td>Multi-line form only</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="kw">For...Next</span> statement</td><td>Multi-line form only; ViviFire deprecates the <span class="kw">Next</span> keyword in favor of <span class="kw">End For</span>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Logical operators</td><td><span class="kw">And</span>, <span class="kw">Or</span>, <span class="kw">Xor</span>; except when the precedence level matters. Each has a different precedence level in ViviFire.</td></tr>

<tr><td><span class="kw">Sub</span> statement</td><td>RB's privacy semantics aside</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="kw">While...Wend</span> statement</td><td>Multi-line form only; ViviFire deprecates the <span class="kw">Wend</span> keyword in favor of <span class="kw">End While</span>.</td></tr>

<h3>Incompatibilities</h3>
<p>The following table summarizes the situations where LB and ViviFire share keywords but they are used for different purposes.</p>
<table border="1">
<thead>
<tr><th>Feature</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="GoTo_Case_Statement.html#">GoTo</a></td>
<td><ul><li>In LB, it is used to unconditionally branch to a label.</li><li>In ViviFire, it is used only in the <span class="kw">GoTo Case</span> statement which is available only inside a <span class="kw">Select...Case</span> block.</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="Rem_Operator.html#">Rem</a></td>
<td><ul><li>In LB, it is short for "remark" and marks the beginning of a remark that extends to the end of the line.</li><li>In ViviFire, it is short for "remainder" and is an operator related to <span class="kw">Mod</span>.</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="Return_Statement.html#">Return</a></td>
<td><ul><li>In LB, it is used to mark the end of a GOSUB routine.</li><li>In ViviFire, it is a shorthand way to set the return value of a <span class="kw">Function</span> or <span class="kw">Method</span> and <span class="kw">Exit</span>, or is just another way to do <span class="kw">Exit Sub</span>.</li></ul></td>
